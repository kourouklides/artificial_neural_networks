# Setup and Installation

This is a step-by-step tutorial that will guide you through the installation of the necessary libraries and how to setup your environment, in order to run the various code examples.

The code should run on any machine (i.e. Windows, macOS, Linux) that supports __Python 3 (64-bit, NOT 32-bit)__ .

__Note:__ It is possible that the code might work with Python 2, either as is or with a few modifications. However, this repository does __not__ support Python 2. Also, there is __no__ guarantee that __individual files__ will work on their own.

## Quick installation

If, for any reason, you want to spend the minimum amount of time for setting up your environment, then you should follow __all__ the steps below.

This installation process requires the __minimum__ knowledge of software tools. It cannot get any easier than this.

### 1. Install Python 3 (64-bit) with Anaconda

In order to save a lot of trouble, download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is actively supported by the Data Science community.

1. Go to [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) page and choose the installation for either [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows), [macOS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) or [Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) accordingly.
1. Choose __Python 3 (64-bit, NOT 32-bit)__ (latest version is fine, since you can create a new environment after you donwload it)

The Anaconda Distribution also includes the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) IDE, which is the one that was used for writting the code examples in this repository. This IDE is considered to be ideal for __Machine Learning, Data Science, Scientific Computing, Computational Science and Engineering__. An other free option is [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

__Note:__ Anaconda uses ``conda`` to create _virtual environments_, so is __cannot__ be used with ``venv`` or ``virtualenv``.

### 2. Install the required packages

The code examples require several Python packages to be installed. These packages are listed in the 
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file of this folder. You do not need to edit the file for the quick installation.

Currently, there are [known issues in TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20444) with Python 3.7+, so follow the instructions below carefully.

You first have to change the directory to the root of the repository, by __replacing__ \<your directory path> accordingly:

    cd <your directory path>/artificial_neural_networks

Then, to install the required Python packages and dependencies you have to run the following commands in a terminal:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate ann
    
__Note:__ For Windows, you should run all of the commands, including the above, at the __Anaconda Prompt__ instead of the Terminal.

### ~~3. Download the datasets~~

~~You need to download the necessary data for each corresponding code example, as they are __not__ inluded in this repository. To do this, follow the instructions in the [datasets](../datasets) folder.~~

    cd <your directory path>/artificial_neural_networks/datasets

## Recommended installation

If you want to use __Docker__ containers, then you should follow __all__ the steps below. Docker containers are especially useful for __Data Science__ and __Research__ code.

This installation process employs best practises and follows industry standards. So, it is highly __recommended__.

### 1. Install Docker

Docker is a very powerful tool. You can read online about [What Docker is](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker) and [Why to use Docker](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/when-and-why-to-use-docker/).

For Windows or Mac:

1. Go to [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page and choose the installation for either [Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) or [macOS](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) accordingly.
1. Follow the instructions in the page above.

For Linux:

1. Go to [Docker Community Edition (CE)](https://docs.docker.com/install/) page and choose the installation for your Linux distribution (e.g. [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)).
1. Follow the instructions in the page above.

## Troubleshoot (if you have errors or problems)

If you face any errors, then please try asking at __all__ of the available forums and websites online __first__. For example:
- [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) and any of its sub-forums, such as [Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and any of its sub-forums, such as [Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)
- any other website similar to the above

If you have asked at __all__ of the available forums and websites online, then in this case, you can copy-paste the URL links of your questions in this repository and ask your question [here](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/issues). We will try our best to resolve the issue(s).
