# Sequential Data

## About
This part of the repository is concerned with __Sequential Data__, including Time Series.

Keywords: Sequential Data, Time Series, Linear Dynamical Systems, State Space Models, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMAX

## Introduction

A __Time Series__ can be either _univariate_ or _multivariate_.

In general, models can be single input (SI), single output (SO), multiple input (MI), multiple output (MO) and any combination (SISO, MIMO, SIMO, MISO). 

## Time Series Forecasting

__Time Series Forecasting__ can be: (i) _One-Step ahead_, (ii) _Multi-Step ahead_ or (iii) _Dynamic_.

__One-Step ahead Time Series Forecasting__ can use either SISO or MISO models.

__Multi-Step ahead Time Series Forecasting__ has [four main strategies](https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-step-time-series-forecasting/):

1. _Direct Strategy_*, when creating many separate SISO/MISO models, one for each time step ahead.

1. _Recursive Strategy_, when using predicted (and possibly actual) values as input to the (one) SISO/MISO model.

1. _Direct-Recursive Hybrid Strategies_*, when combining the two methods.

1. _Multiple Output Strategy_, when using only actual (and not predicted) values as input to the (one) SIMO/MIMO model.

\* Strategies 1 and 3 are much more _computational intensive_ (than the rest ones), since many separate models need to be trained during the Training Phase.

- [Statistical Signal Processing](https://wiki.kourouklides.com/wiki/Statistical_Signal_Processing)

The wiki contains curated lists of online and offline resources (e.g. books, papers, URL links) about these topics.
